# Tkinter_Examples

More a reference repo for myself, as I come across different methods of doing things
I will try to keep a record of the code I used for particular situations

My experience with GUI programming doesnt include anything too complex, 
I am trying to cover as much as I can in Tkinter,

then move on to Tix - a module that extends the Tk toolkit massively

A lot of the stuff included is my own method af doing things within my
tkinter applications, but there may be the odd example I have come across
when I have been stuck on a particular thing - I always leave credits
where due

I hope that if you end up here, there is something helpful
Or, if you are here by following my Tutorial videos and pages,
If theres anything you couldn't fing or needed, give me a shout
and I will try to help you out
